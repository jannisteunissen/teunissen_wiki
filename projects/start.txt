===== Projects =====

Here is a list of projects that I'm involved with.

==== AFiVO ====

AFiVO stands for **//Adaptive Finite Volume Octree//**. From the
[[https://github.com/jannisteunissen/afivo|Github page]]: "The goal of this
project is to provide a framework for adaptive finite volume simulations, with a
focus on simplicity and adaptive grid refinement." Documentation can be found
[[http://cwimd.nl/doku.php?id=codes:afivo|here]].

==== Pamdi3d ====

Pamdi3d stands for **//Particle Model Discharge 3D//**. It is precisely that: a
particle model for 3D simulations of discharges. Specifically, we focus on the
simulation of so-called streamer discharges. Documentation can be found
[[http://cwimd.nl/doku.php?id=codes:particle|here]], the source code on
this[[https://github.com/jannisteunissen/afivo|Github page]].

==== Monte-Carlo Particle swarm ====

Using the basic particle module that is also used for pamdi3d, this is a simple
implementation of a Boltzmann solver for electrons in gases. You can compute
transport data like the electron mobility, diffusion coefficient and the
ionization rate. The code can be found
[[https://github.com/jannisteunissen/particle_swarm|here]].

==== streamer_1d ====

A simple code to run particle and fluid simulations for 1D "streamers" or
ionization waves. Nice for comparing models. There isn't much documentation yet,
but the code can be found
[[https://github.com/jannisteunissen/streamer_1d|here]].

==== DVVA website ====

I'm the current maintainer of the [[http://dvva.nl|website of DVVA]], my
football((The type of football where you put your //foot// against the
//ball//)) club.
