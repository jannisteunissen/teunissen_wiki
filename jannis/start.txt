===== About me =====

Hi, I’m Jannis Teunissen.
{{ jannis.jpg?100|That's me. Minnie from CWI took the picture}}
I grew up in Amsterdam (The Netherlands), on the
Niewendammerdijk. This street can still feel a bit like the countryside. In 1999
I started to cross the IJ everyday, because I attended a secondary school in the
city centre ([[wp>Barlaeus_Gymnasium|Barlaeus]]).
After finishing in 2005, I did a bachelor in Physics and
Astronomy at the [[wp>University_of_Amsterdam|University of Amsterdam]].

In 2008, I enrolled in a masters programme in theoretical physics, but after a
few months I decided that this wasn’t what I was looking for. Later that year it
became clear to me that I wanted to do a master in
[[http://gss.uva.nl/future-msc-students/information-sciences/content27/computational-science.html|computational
science]], also at the University of Amsterdam. There were two reasons for this:

  * Pen-and-paper calculations only get you so far in physics, and I wanted to be able to solve more problems.
  * I enjoyed programming quite a bit.

Compared to theoretical physics, I felt solving problems on a computer allowed
for much more creativity. Of course you can also be creative in theoretical
physics, but most of the time you don’t come up with something that makes sense.

So the next year (2009), I started a master in Computational Science at the
University of Amsterdam. After finishing in 2011, I started a PhD at CWI in
computational plasma physics, in the group of Ute Ebert.

At the moment, I’m still working on my PhD. You can find out more about my
