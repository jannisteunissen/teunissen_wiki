==== Life and video games ====

I'd say life and video games are pretty similar:
  * It's nice to play with others
  * Typically, you want to get good at it
  * There are three main motives to actively participate:
    - To enjoy yourself now
    - To invest in future enjoyment
    - To not have to think about it all

And if you think about the "real" goal for a long time, there really isn't any.

==== Surprising habits ====

  * To be quite critical in your choice of clothes, food, shoes and so on, but to never put any effort in picking a comfortable mouse and keyboard.
  * To use a laptop as your primary computer (with no external keyboard, monitor and mouse).
  * To use a desk and a chair that are not comfortable.
  * To not know basic keyboard shortcuts after years of using the same environment.

The most plausible explanation I can think of, is that some people are just
completely captured by the interaction with the screen. It greatly reduces their
other senses, especially those related to comfort.

==== A similarity between friendship and knowledge ====

A solid foundation brings you confidence. Maintaining and further strengthening
it provides deeper insights, that are otherwise hard to obtain. But when you get
comfortable, explorations into something new are the easiest way to see more.
