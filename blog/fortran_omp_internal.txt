===== Internal procedures & OpenMP in Fortran =====

Does the following (pseudo)code work?
<code fortran>
program test
  ...
contains

subroutine a()
  !$omp do
  do i = 1, N
    call b()
  end do
  !$omp end do
end subroutine a

subroutine b()
  ...
end subroutine b
end program test
</code>

My experience with GFortran and ifort is that this can *sometimes* work, but
often does not. Passing an internal procedures as an arguments inside an
parallel loop is probably even less likely to work.
