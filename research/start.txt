===== Research =====

After leaving high school in 2005, I had to choose a university course. There
were three topics that I wanted to study:

   * How a (human) brain works
   * How a computer works
   * How nature works

Itâ€™s now ten years later, and I have mostly been busy with the latter two
questions. Currently, my primary research interests are computational science
and computational physics. I like to study systems that have some intrinsic
complexity, not coming from boundary conditions or input data.

==== PhD ====

I'm currently working as a PhD student in the group [[http://cwimd.nl|Multiscale
Dynamics]]((This is our official (CWI-hosted)
[[https://www.cwi.nl/research-groups/Multiscale-Dynamics|webpage]])) at CWI.
[[http://homepages.cwi.nl/~ebert/|Ute Ebert]] is my promotor / supervisor.
The main topic of my PhD is the modeling of low-temperature discharges,
specifically the modeling of
[[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Streamer_discharge|streamer discharges]], see also my [[publications:thesis|thesis]].

My publications can be found [[publications:start|here]].
