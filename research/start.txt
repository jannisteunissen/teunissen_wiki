===== Research =====

After finishing secondary school in 2005, there were three topics that I wanted
to study:

   * How a (human) brain works
   * How a computer works
   * How nature works

Itâ€™s now ten years later, and I have mostly been busy with the latter two
questions. Currently, my primary research interests are computational science
and computational physics. I like to study systems that have some intrinsic
complexity, not coming from boundary conditions or input data.

==== PhD ====

I have just finished my [[publications:thesis|PhD thesis]]. The work was done in
the [[http://cwimd.nl|Multiscale Dynamics]]((This is our official (CWI-hosted)
[[https://www.cwi.nl/research-groups/Multiscale-Dynamics|webpage]])) group at
CWI, under the supervision of [[http://homepages.cwi.nl/~ebert/|Ute Ebert]].
